            Today on June 18, 2020, AUCT is releasing its logo which denotes the strength of the Unaided teachers of
            colleges of Punjab. It will always inspire, motivate and boost the morale of the educators who are
            determined to fight till the last for the causes which are dear to them for the sake of education and their
            own welfare. <br><br>

            Friends, Always bear in mind that in the logo the hand wielding the pen is My Pen, Your Pen and the Pen that
            belongs to us all, And the effective power of this pen alone will keep encouraging us to struggle for our
            just rights. <br><br>
            AUCT expresses its sense of deep thankfulness to( Dr.Baldev Singh of Lyallpur Khalsa College, Jalandhar and
            Prof. Jaspal Singh of GGS Khalsa College, Sarhali,Tarn Taran) who conceived and gave the final aesthetic
            shape to this 'Logo'. <br><br>
